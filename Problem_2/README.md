### PROBLEM 2: Sum even fibonacci up to 4,000,000

> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
> 
> `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...`
> 
> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Solution: The fibonacci sequence is defined as:
![equation]()

So, we can continue to generate the sequence until we reach a term over `4000000`, and maintain a running sum of all the even terms along the way.

```javascript
function genFibonacciToN(num) {
	var sequence = [1,1];
	var result = 0;
    var current;
	while(sequence[sequence.length - 1] <= num) {
		current = sequence[sequence.length - 1] + sequence[sequence.length - 2];
		if (current % 2 == 0)
			result += current;
		sequence.push(current);
	}
	return result;
}
```
