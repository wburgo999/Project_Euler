excerpt: |
  If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9.
  <br />The sum of these multiples is 23.
  Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Naive solution: just loop through from 1 to 1000, and add each multiple of 3 or 5 to a running total. An easy way to check if a number, n, is a multiple of m,
is whether n % m is 0;

{% highlight js %}
function sumMultiplesOf3And5() {
  var sum = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 === 0) sum += i;
  }
  return sum;
}
{% endhighlight %}
