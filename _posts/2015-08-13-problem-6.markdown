title:  "Problem 6: Sum Square Difference"
date:   2015-08-11 13:43:21
excerpt: |
  The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
  
  <br /><br />1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + ... + 10<sup>2</sup> = 385
  The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
  
  <br /><br />(1 + 2 + ... + 10)<sup>2</sup> = 55<sup>2</sup> = 3025
  <br /><br />Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.
  
  <br /><br />Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

The brute force solution is pretty straightforward:

{% highlight js %}
add the numbers 1 to 100
square the total
subtract the square of each number from 1 to 100
{% endhighlight %}

In code:
{% highlight js %}
function sumSquareDifference() {
  var total = 0;
  for (var i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    total += i;
  };
  total = total * total;
  for (var i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    total -= i * i;
  }
  return total;
}
{% endhighlight %}
Our solution is, `sumSquareDifference()`:

> 25164150 

Let's see if we can reach a more elegant solution.

I'm going to divide the algorithm into two separate functions and see if we can derive pure mathematical solutions for these helper functions.

{% highlight js %}
function sumSquareDifference(n) {
  return squareOfSums(n) - sumOfSquares(n);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Let's start with `squareOfSums`. We know that the sum of the natural numbers from `1..n` is `n(n+1)/2`.

{% highlight js %}
function squareOfSums(n) {
  var sums = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
  return sums * sums;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Similarly, for `sumOfSquares`, we know the sum of squares from `1..n` is 

`(n * (n + 1) * (2n + 1)) / 6`.

{% highlight js %}
function sumOfSquares(n) {
  return (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 6;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Again, our solution is `sumSquareDifference(100)`;
