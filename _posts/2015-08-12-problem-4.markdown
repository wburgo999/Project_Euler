In Pseudocode:

{% highlight js %}
Generate all products of 2 three digit numbers
sort these products
loop from largest to smallest product
  if product is a palindrome
    return product
{% endhighlight %}

In code:

{% highlight js %}
function largestPalindromeProduct() {
  var products = genProducts()
  products = products.sort(function(a,b) {return b-a});
  for (var i = 0; i < products.length; i++) {
    if (isPalindrome(products[i])) return products[i];
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}


To generate the products array, loop through all 3 digit numbers and push the product to the products array.

{% highlight js %}
function genProducts(num) {
  var products = [];
  for(var i = 100; i < num; i++) {
    for(var j = 100; j <= i; j++) { //j starts at i to avoid double counting products
      products.push(i*j);
    }
  }
  return products;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now let's write out `isPalindrome` function. We check whether the reverse of the number is equal to itself.

{% highlight js %}
function isPalindrome(num) {
  return String(num).split('').reverse().join('') === String(num);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Our solution is, `largestPalindromeProduct`:

> 906609 


This solution is far from ideal, though. We don't want to have to generate the entire products array. We want to check the largest possible product first and then generate smaller ones as needed. I'll cover a better solution in the next post
